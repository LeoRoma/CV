## Jia Tian Xia ('Leo')

As my name is difficult to pronounce everybody calls me Leo. Before I trained to be a software developer, I was an award-winning Sushi Chef with a strong international background developed through education and work experience in Italy, China, and UK. 
Working in a kitchen, I have always enjoyed meeting people from different countries and have the opportunity to have a cultural and language exchange. However, even if I was very passionate about cooking, after working at different restaurants in London, I realised that the tasks were repetitive. My daily routine started to become monotonous, so I decided to join [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) and challenge myself to become a software developer, with the curiosity to learn how applications and websites are built.

## Skills

# Organisational

Working in different restaurants during my career as a chef, I learned how to be organised and using my time efficiently. Being a chef comes with high pressure, and so it is very important to calculate the time for each food preparation and be ready for the service.

Mostly in my daily routine before to arrive at the workplace I was planning in my mind all the preparations I had to do it, estimate the time one by one, so I could sort them in order by timing.
I have taken these skills into my coding. I will plan my day so I can set out which goals I want to achieve by the end of the day.

# Communication

Whether working in a kitchen or coding in a team project, I understand that communication is the key. If there is no communication in a kitchen, it is certain that the dishes will be delayed. I have realised that the same applied to coding, in that if there is poor communication, some team members might make changes to the code which has an impact on the code the rest of the team is writing. It especially is very important to keep updated with your colleagues to be constantly synchronized with your team. 

# Teamwork

Teamwork for me is another element that I believe brings any company success - even if you are the strongest person in your team you cannot do everything alone. 
In our final group project, we found ourselves behind schedule as there were some issues with the front end. At this stage, there was only three hours to go before our presentation. To resolve the issue we did mob programming in a final three-hour sprint, and by sharing our knowledge and focusing on a common goal, we were able to resolve the issue and celebrate our success.

## Hobbies

- Baking bread: I found baking bread a very interesting hobby. You have to deal with many variables such as water temperature, room temperature, type of flour, yeast, time to raise and need a lot of patience.  At the moment I have never succeeded to make the same bread 2 times in a row. Every time I need to take notes and apply a few small changes in the process for the next bread.

- Workout: It is very important to be healthy. Even if sometimes I slip into drinking very easily! 

- Guitar: I always wanted to learn to play an instrument. This is quite challenging to do self-led.

- Cooking: even if I want to change my career I still like cooking. I especially try to cook different recipes and different varieties of food.

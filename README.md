## Jia Tian Xia ('Leo')

As my name is difficult to pronounce everybody calls me Leo. Before I trained to be a software developer, I was an award-winning Sushi Chef ([See link](http://sushichallenge.global/uk-sushi-chef-xia-tia-jian-set-for-global-sushi-stardom/)) with a strong international background developed through education and work experience in Italy, China, and UK. 

Altough passionate about cooking, I am looking for a change in career, specifically I am attracted to full stack development.
I find backend very interesting, because I like the logic involved in creating interconnected systems through Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
On the other hand I find frontend a good way to express my creativity through visual design.
As an aspiring junior developer, I would like to challenge myself and my end-to-end critical thinking in a fast-paced environment.

## Skills

#### Process thinking

In my working experience, I like to create a structured method of working, to always keep track of my learning process. For this purpose, I found the Agile methodology particularly helpful to work efficiently. I plan daily goals, take notes and measure my perfomance against these milestones.

Moreover, I find this mindset useful in a team environment to define clear roles and responsibilities, which is fundamental to delegate and assign tasks effectively.

#### Adaptability

As a chef I worked in multicultural and fastpaced environments, developing good communication skills, and the flexibility to maintain a level-head under pressure.

#### Attention to detail

Working with Japanese Chefs I also learned to appreciate dedication, precision, and the relentless pursuit of mastering one's craft in any field of work.

This experience helped me develop a particular attention to detail and strong commitment to deliverables.

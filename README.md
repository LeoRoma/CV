## Jia Tian Xia ('Leo')

As my name is difficult to pronounce everybody calls me Leo. Before I trained to be a software developer, I was an award-winning Sushi Chef ([See link](http://dialogueagency.com/xia-jia-tian-from-kouzu-crowned-the-uks-top-sushi-chef/)) with a strong international background developed through education and work experience in Italy, China, and UK. 

Working in a kitchen, I have always enjoyed meeting people from different countries and have the opportunity to have a cultural and language exchange. However, even if I was very passionate about cooking, I wanted to look for something that was more challenging, as I did a little bit of coding when I was in High School, I decided to start a new adventure and challenge myself with coding.

Before to join [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), with their recommendation I started to do CodeWars' katas, and slowly with the passing of time, I became more curious about coding, and wanted to learn how applications and websites are built. 

## Skills

#### Organisational

Working in different restaurants as a chef, I was consistently working under high-pressure. Consequently, I needed to ensure I delegated adequate time to preparation of different food items, whilst ensuring prepared food was ready for service. Translating this into my code, I follow an AGILE methodology which allows me to be aware of which roles and responsibilities have been delegated within my team to allow more seamless product development.

#### Communication

Whether working in a kitchen or coding in a team project, I understand that communication is the key. If there is no communication in a kitchen, it is certain that the dishes will be delayed. 

I have realised that the same applied to coding, in that if there is poor communication, some team members might make changes to the code which has an impact on the code the rest of the team is writing. It especially is very important to keep updated with your colleagues to be constantly synchronized with your team. 

#### Teamwork

Teamwork for me is another element that I believe brings any company success - even if you are the strongest person in your team you cannot do everything alone. 

In our final group project, we found ourselves behind schedule as there were some issues with the front end. At this stage, there was only three hours to go before our presentation. To resolve the issue we did mob programming in a final three-hour sprint, and by sharing our knowledge and focusing on a common goal, we were able to resolve the issue and celebrate our success.

## Hobbies

- Baking bread: I found baking bread a very interesting hobby. You have to deal with many variables such as water temperature, room temperature, type of flour, yeast, time to raise and need a lot of patience.  At the moment I have never succeeded to make the same bread 2 times in a row. Every time I need to take notes and apply a few small changes in the process for the next bread.

- Workout: It is very important to be healthy. Even if sometimes I slip into drinking very easily! 

- Guitar: I always wanted to learn to play an instrument, even if I am not very good on that and is very difficult to learn by your own, I just keep trying to learn some new technique and songs, especially having fun.

- Cooking: even if I want to change my career I still like cooking. I especially try to cook different recipes and different varieties of food.

# Organisational

Working in different restaurants during my career as chef I had the possibility to learn how to be organised and possibly using most efficiently the time, considering is a job with an high pressure is very important to calculate the time for each preparation and be ready for the service.
Mostly in my daily routine before to arrive at workplace I was planning in my mind all the preparations I had to do it, estimate the time one by one, so I could sort them in order by timing.
Either in coding, I have found it very important to make a plan before to my day, so I could understand better which goals I had to achieve at the end of the day or at the end of the week.

# Communication

Either in kitchen or while I was working in a team project communication is the key, if there is not communication in kitchen is sure that the dishes will be in delay, and in coding I have realized that sometimes is possible to implement functionality for the app that they are not required or is also very easy to go out of track. Especially is very important to keep updated with your colleagues to be consinstantly synchronized with your team. 

# Teamwork

Teamwork for me is another element that I believe brings any company to the success, consider the fact even if you are the strongest person in your team you still can't do everything alone, but I have found it quite difficult to find a goal or motivation that can keep a team all together, and is also very important to help whoever is left behind and bring this person to the same level of the others.

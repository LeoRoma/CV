## Jia Tian Xia

As my name is difficult to pronounce everybody calls me Leo, before Makers I was an award-winning Sushi Chef with a strong international background developed through education and work experience in Italy, China, and the UK. 

Working in a kitchen definitely I have always enjoying to know people from different countries and have the possibility to have a cultural and language exchange, but even if I was very passionate about cooking, after moving different restaurants in London I have realized the redundant tasks that I had to fulfill every day and they started to be monotonous on my daily routine, so I decided to join Makers and challenge myself to become a software developer, with the curiosity to learn how the application and website are built.

## Skills

# Organisational

Working in different restaurants during my career as a chef I could learn how to be organized and possibly using most efficiently the time, considering is a job with high pressure is very important to calculate the time for each preparation and be ready for the service.

Mostly in my daily routine before to arrive at the workplace I was planning in my mind all the preparations I had to do it, estimate the time one by one, so I could sort them in order by timing.
Either in coding, I have found it very important to make a plan before to my day, so I could understand better which goals I had to achieve at the end of the day or the end of the week.

# Communication

Either in kitchen or while I was working in a team project communication is the key, if there is not communication in kitchen is sure that the dishes will be in delay, and in coding I have realized that sometimes is possible to implement functionality for the app that they are not required or is also very easy to go out of track. It especially is very important to keep updated with your colleagues to be constantly synchronized with your team. 

# Teamwork

Teamwork for me is another element that I believe brings any company to success, consider the fact even if you are the strongest person in your team you still can't do everything alone. 

In my final project with my team we had some issues with the front end and we mobbed for 3 hours to find a workaround to set our buttons because they were overlapping, so we collected all our knowledge that we gather for React Native to finally solve our problems, the feeling to part of a team and working altogether to achieve the same goal that we had in common during this last 3 hours sprint which was getting ready our application for the presentation for the end of the course because we were late, we ended up to manage to complete the application and finally celebrate our success it's something that I believe that any team needs to have the same goal which gathers altogether.
